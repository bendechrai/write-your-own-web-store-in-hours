# Write Your Own Web Store In Hours

⚠️ **Note**

You're welcome to do this before the workshop too, but we will start here as a group anyway.

## 🍽️ Fork This Repository

> A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment and commit changes without affecting the original project.

👉💻👈 Click the Fork button in the top right, and select where to fork it to.

💡 If you are a member of any Github organisations, you might be prompted to choose between forking to your personal account or to one of your organisations, as shown below. If you're not sure which to choose, then it's likely your personal account is the best place to fork to.

## 💻 Start Your Gitpod Development Environment

The hardest part with workshops is getting your development environment ready. Fear not. We're using Gitpod for this.

> ![Open in Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/svg/media-kit/logo-dark-theme.svg)
>
> Gitpod lets you spin up fresh, automated dev environments for each task, in the cloud, in seconds. The free tier gives you 50 hours of usage per month.

👉💻👈 Prefix the URL in the address bar with `gitpod.io/#`

So if you've cloned this to:

```
https://github.com/yourname/write-your-own-web-store-in-hours
```

you'll want to go to:

```
https://gitpod.io/#github.com/yourname/write-your-own-web-store-in-hours
```

If you're prompted to log in, do so with your Github account. You might be prompted to choose your preferred editor (this workshop assumes you're using VS Code in the browser), and then you'll end up with something looking like this:

## ⚙️ Install the Netlify CLI

We're not going to be deploying to Netlify, but we do want to use the Netlify developer tools so that the lambda functions we write today can be served locally for testing.

👉💻👈 In Gitpod's web-based editor, open the command terminal and install Netlify's command line (CLI) tools

```shell
npm install netlify-cli -g
```
