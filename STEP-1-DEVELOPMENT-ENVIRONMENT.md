## ⚙️ Install the Netlify CLI

We're not going to be deploying to Netlify, but we do want to use the Netlify developer tools so that the lambda functions we write today can be served locally for testing.

👉💻👈 In Gitpod's web-based editor, open the command terminal and install Netlify's command line (CLI) tools

```shell
npm install netlify-cli -g
```
